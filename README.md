I created a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information:


1. The ticker symbol.


2. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


3.The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


4. The total stock volume of the stock.
